TODO:
 - Implement more specialised command line arguments:
   
   csvn [options]

   csvn [<svn options>]
   csvn [<csvn options>]
   csvn [<csvn options> '--' <svn options>]

   Meaning: either ALL options are for svn OR ALL options are for csvn
   OR csvn options come before svn options and they are separated by
   '--' (double dash).

   As csvn has less options than svn, it first checks for csvn options
   and, if found, looks for the separating double dash (--); if this
   isn't found it is assumed all options are for csvn. If the first
   options fail to identify as csvn options, they are assumed to be
   svn options.
