TODO:
 - Implement more specialised command line arguments:
   
   csvn [options]

   csvn [<svn options>]
   csvn [<csvn options>]
   csvn [<csvn options> '--' <svn options>]

   Meaning: either ALL options are for svn OR ALL options are for csvn
   OR csvn options come before svn options and they are separated by
   '--' (double dash).

   As csvn has less options than svn, it first checks for csvn options
   and, if found, looks for the separating double dash (--); if this
   isn't found it is assumed all options are for csvn. If the first
   options fail to identify as csvn options, they are assumed to be
   svn options.

 - FIXME: Pass arguments to Subversion, preserving the quotes

 - commit: treat -m, -F and no message differently
   Dream: to be able to specify whether or not the
   'prepare-commit-msg' hook should be allowed to run, even when -m or
   -F have been specified.
