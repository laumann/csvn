csvn
====

Client side SVN (csvn) aims to bring some customizability of Subversion
to the client-side user experience.

About
-----

From csvn's usage string:

    Client side Subversion sucks - there is very little
    customisability, which completely ruins the experience for a lot
    of users. This bundle of scripts wraps around the svn command line
    tool to provide the extra functionality that YOU want.

The idea is specifically to allow the user to seamlessly use _csvn_
instead of _svn_, but expand upon the control the user has.

One example is hooks - the server side can set up hooks for various
things, while the client side has no such support. csvn mimics git in
allowing certain - if present under the right name - to be called, and
have the user execute some of their chosen code. At the moment, the
following commit hooks exist:

 - pre-commit: To check the validity of something before beginning the
   commit
 - prepare-commit-msg: Dedicated to preparing the commit message, for
   instance inject certain information into the commit message
   template.
 - commit-msg: Used to check the commit message, once it has been
   saved (and the commit is about to begin)
 - post-commit: Called when a succesful commit has been made.
